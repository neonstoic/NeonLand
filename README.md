# NeonLand

## Summary
Decentralized Metaverse platforms already exist. Platforms like Decentraland or Somnium use Ethereum as the blockchain and their own tokens for exchanging land. The worlds themselves may or may not exist as non-fungible tokens on their respective blockchains, but certainly utilizing NFT's for land space is a perfect use case.

This project is an experiment by using Bitclout as a foundation for a decentralized land ownership model.

## Creating World space
- In NeonLand, world space first needs to be created.
- Worldspace is created through minting NFT's.
- The initial worldspace would be issued as a 100x100 grid through the @neonland post/NFT, #worldspace,100x100,“In retrospect, it was inevitable”
- This NFT would not go on sale but be kept held by @neonland

## Issuing Land parcels
- Each individual point on the grid would be, itself, issued by @neonland as a NFT.
- Each point would be called a "Land Parcel", borrowing from other decentralized land models
- Land parcels are issued through messages on the bitclout blockchain from the @neonland account, similar to worldspace.
- A post/NFT that issues the land parcel would be something like, #parcel,001,001,"Some message perhaps"
- Unlike worldspace NFTs, the Parcel NFT would be open for auction.
- Any parcel issued as a NFT and held by @neonland would be put up for auction
- When a parcel is held by an account other than @neonland, it is considered owned by that account.
- Hodlers of @neonland parcel NFTs can re-sell them

## The App
- A web app would initially be created to show the land ownership by reading the Bitclout blockchain

## Future Considerations
- Creation of asset NFT's that can be placed on land parcels
- Building of 3d space that can be navigated to online in browser or VR
